# popGenMachineLearningExamples

This repository is meant to house a series of jupyter notebooks that showcase some simple examples of using supervised machine learning for population genetics inference. 

The first notebook that we have added `demographicModelSelectionExample.ipynb` is meant as a companion to our recent review-- Schrider and Kern (2017) "Machine learning for population genetics: a new paradigm." That paper can be found on bioRxiv here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/10/20/206482
